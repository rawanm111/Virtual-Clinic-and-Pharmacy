# MetaCare

The Clinic Management System streamlines patient registration, doctor requests, and administrative tasks. Patients can manage records, appointments, prescriptions, and health packages, while doctors gain a comprehensive view of patient data. The system enhances communication through video calls, making healthcare accessible.

[![Build Status](Your_CI_Service_Build_Badge_Link)](Your_CI_Service_Build_Link)

The build status reflects the current state of continuous integration for this project. It helps ensure that the latest changes in the repository pass automated tests and maintain the integrity of the codebase.

Please note the following considerations:

- *Styles:* Prefer using external styles (CSS files) over inline styles for better separation of concerns. This practice promotes maintainability and readability in the long run.

- *Reusable Components:* Encourage the use of reusable components, such as AppBars, to enhance code modularity and maintainability. The project encourages encapsulating common functionalities in separate components for easier maintenance and future enhancements.

Addressing these considerations will contribute to a more robust and maintainable codebase.

## Code Style📜

The project follows a consistent coding style to ensure readability and maintainability. Please adhere to the following guidelines when contributing to the codebase:

 ### 1. File Organization

- *Import Statements:* Keep import statements organized at the top of each file.

 ### 2. Component Structure

- Ensure a clear and organized structure for React components.

 ### 3. React Hooks

- Leverage React Hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.) for managing state and side effects in functional components.

 ### 4. Axios Requests

- Make asynchronous requests using Axios within the useEffect hook.

 ### 5. Conditional Rendering

- Use conditional rendering to provide a better user experience during loading states.

 ### 6. State Naming

- Maintain consistency in naming conventions for states.

### 7. Error Handling

- Provide meaningful error messages and log errors for debugging purposes.
Feel free to refer to the existing codebase for examples of these conventions.

## Code Examples💻
### Example 1: How to Create a Patient(Backend)

    const patientModel = require('../Models/patients');
    const patients = require('../Models/patients');
    const walletModel = require('../Models/Wallet'); // Import the wallet model
    const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');

    exports.createPatient = async (req, res) => {
     const {
    fullName,
    email,
    dateOfBirth,
    gender,
    mobileNumber,
    emergencyContactFullName,
    emergencyContactMobileNumber,
    emergencyContactRelationToPatient,
    password, 
    username,
    } = req.body;
    try {
 
      const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(); 
      const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, salt);
      const newPatient= new patientModel({
        username,
        fullName,
        email,
        dateOfBirth,
        gender,
        mobileNumber ,
        emergencyContactFullName ,
        emergencyContactMobileNumber,
        emergencyContactRelationToPatient,
        password: hashedPassword,
      });

      const newWallet = new walletModel({
        patient: newPatient._id, // Assuming patientModel has an _id field
        balance: 0, // You can set an initial balance if needed
      });
      // Save the wallet
      const savedWallet = await newWallet.save();
      // Update the patient with the wallet information
      newPatient.wallet = savedWallet._id;
      const savedPatient = await newPatient.save();
      res.status(200).json(savedPatient)
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
      res.status(400).json({ error: error.message })
    } };


### Example 2: How to add medicine to cart(Backend)
    exports.addToCart = async (req, res) => {
    try {
    const { patientId, medicationId, quantity } = req.body;

    // Find the patient's cart or create one if it doesn't exist
    let cart = await Cart.findOne({ patientId });

    if (!cart) {
      cart = new Cart({patientId, medications: [] });
    }

    // Check if the medication is already in the cart
    const existingMedication = cart.medications.find(
      (item) => item.medicationId.toString() === medicationId
    );

    if (existingMedication) {
      // If the medication is already in the cart, update its quantity
      existingMedication.quantity += quantity;
    } else {
      // If not, add the medication to the cart
      cart.medications.push({ medicationId, quantity });
    }

    // Save the cart
    const updatedCart = await cart.save();

    res.status(200).json(updatedCart);
    } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).json(err);
    }
    };

### Example 2: How to Change Password(Frontend)
    import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
    import axios from 'axios';
    import Alert from '@mui/material/Alert';
    import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';
    import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';
    const isValidPassword = (password) => {
    const regex = /^(?=.[A-Z])(?=.\d).{4,}$/;
    return regex.test(password);
    };
    const handleCloseChangePassword = () => {
    setChangePasswordOpen(false);
    };

    const updatePassword = async (newPassword) => {
    try {
    // Replace '/api/reset-password' with your actual API endpoint
    const response = await axios.put('http://localhost:3000/changepassword', { id, newPassword });
    console.log(response.data);
    setAlertType('success');
    setAlertOpen(true);
    } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error updating password:', error);
    setAlertType('error');
    setAlertOpen(true);
    }
    };

    const handleOpenChangePassword = () => {
    setChangePasswordOpen(true);
    };

## Tests 🧪
The api routes were tested using postman,
Postman is an application used for API testing. It is an HTTP client that tests HTTP requests, utilizing a graphical user interface, through which we obtain different types of responses that need to be subsequently validated. Postman offers many endpoint interaction methods. The following are some of the most used, including their functions:
*   GET: Obtain information
*   POST: Add information
*   PUT: Replace information
*   PATCH: Update certain information
*   DELETE: Delete information
& And we tested the behavior of our routes and if they produce the correct status code and response according to our project flow .you will fine the main routes in app.js. and the sub ones in each parts routes folder in the backend. For example, you will find something  like this in the app.js “app.use('/patients', PatientRoutes);” and something like this in the routes file of patients” router.get('/', PatientController.getPatient);” so you test like this.      http://localhost:3000/patients/  using “get” in postman. In this way you can test almost all aspects of the project for example here patient registration by getting all patients.
